# RShinyAging
shiny app for biologists to enter aging data

Notes for next year:    

- Brandon Rochefort asked if there will be an option to filter/search by harvest year in the future. It might be nice to have a plot at the bottom of the Data Review tab that shows sample sizes by year for observer, processor, or DMU.    
- Request that DeerID uses 01, 02, 03, etc. for first 9 numbers so that the order stays the same when looking at upload and master data.  
- Have a tab where the datasheet can be downloaded (not sure if that is possible) and includes instructions on the cell dropdowns (and not sure if the download would need to be excel [because of the cell constraints] then saved as a csv) and screenshots if need be.
