# RShinyAging
shiny app for biologists to enter aging data

Notes for next year:    

- Brandon Rochefort asked if there will be an option to filter/search by harvest year in the future. It might be nice to have a plot at the bottom of the Data Review tab that shows sample sizes by year for observer, processor, or DMU.    
- Request that DeerID uses 01, 02, 03, etc. for first 9 numbers so that the order stays the same when looking at upload and master data.  
- Have a tab where the datasheet can be downloaded (not sure if that is possible) and includes instructions on the cell dropdowns (and not sure if the download would need to be excel [because of the cell constraints] then saved as a csv) and screenshots if need be.  
- Folks are still not using the drop down cell values. Is there a way to have an auto-correct or auto-fill happen when they start typing? Or should we get rid of the drop downs and have more errors for them to correct?    
- There should no commas in the csv file. One person had commas in the Comments column which caused the deerid number to be recycled in the comments column. Another person had a comma in a processor name (Kewaskum Foods, LLC).  
- Angela Lemminger emailed that the numbers in the review tab did not look correct. The master db indicated the data was uploaded multiple times and showed multiple versions of the DeerID which wouldn't have been caught as duplicates. For example, there were cases of DeerID = "CotterJasonCotterJason100" and "CotterJasonCotterJasonCotterJason100". So they uploaded the downloaded error file at least twice.   
- The file naming convention that people are using sucks. When folks would email with app questions, I would received data files that were named "Copy of Data Entry Template_erros (1).csv" or "Copy of Data Entry Template_Newcsv3.xlsx".  
- Folks may have been using the template but weren't using the drop down box? For example, there were folks that had spelling errors in the county name.
